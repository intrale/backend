# Proposed Tasks

Based on the current code base, here are some potential tasks to improve the project:

1. **Improve Documentation**
   - Extend the `README.md` with setup instructions, how to build and run the project, and an overview of the design.

2. **Implement Unit Tests**
   - Create tests for the functions and request handlers using a testing framework such as JUnit or Kotlin Test.
   - Add test examples for the authorization logic in `SecuredFunction`.

3. **Fix and Extend Data Classes**
   - Finish implementing the `Request` class. Currently it declares fields but has no logic or methods.
   - Review other classes (e.g., `UnauthorizeExeption`) for typos and naming consistency.

4. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Return more descriptive errors when a function is not found or when JWT validation fails.
   - Consider creating a common error response structure.

5. **Logging Enhancements**
   - Replace `println` statements with a proper logging framework (e.g., SLF4J with Logback).
   - Add a standard logging configuration to the project.

6. **Configuration Management**
   - Allow configuration values in `Config.kt` to come from environment variables or external configuration files.
   - Document these variables in the project documentation.

7. **Add Example Functions**
   - Provide sample business functions implementing the `Function` interface to demonstrate usage.

8. **Continuous Integration**
   - Set up CI workflow to build and test the project automatically.

These tasks will help make the project easier to maintain and extend.
